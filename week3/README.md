# TODO server with UI

## todo-final
* Working backend code server get/post/put/delete todo related apis
* UI which supports adding new todos, showing the result and support for delete
* To run the code:
  * Run `npm install express`
  * Run `npm install cors`
  * Run `node todo-final/todoServer.solution.simple.js`
* Open the browser and launch the filesystem path for index.html and then try the add, delete options
  * delete doesn't auto-refresh the UI for now (has to be fixed). So have to keep refreshing the page
